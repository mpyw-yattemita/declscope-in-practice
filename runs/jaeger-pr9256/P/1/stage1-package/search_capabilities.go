// SearchCapabilities describes how a Reader's search methods behave where
// backends differ. Reader.SearchCapabilities returns it.
//
// The zero value is the least capable reader: every bool is false and Filter
// is nil. A field added later is therefore unset for every implementation that
// does not set it, so a reader never claims a capability it was not written for.
type SearchCapabilities struct {
	// WithoutServiceName is true when FindTraces, FindTraceIDs and
	// FindTraceSummaries accept a TraceQueryParams whose ServiceName is empty
	// and read it as "any service", rather than as an error or an empty result.
	WithoutServiceName bool

	// SameSpanConjunction is true when a conjunction (several entries in the
	// Attributes map, or an OpAnd in Filter) is satisfied within a single span.
	// False means the backend may satisfy different conjuncts from different
	// spans of the same trace, as a flat inverted index does. Callers report
	// this looser scoping rather than refusing the query.
	SameSpanConjunction bool

	// Filter is how much of TraceQueryParams.Filter the reader evaluates. A nil
	// Filter means none of it: the reader serves only the legacy fields. An
	// empty FilterCapabilities means the same; ask Filter.IsEmpty.
	Filter *FilterCapabilities
